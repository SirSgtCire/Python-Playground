Hello and welcome to QAS, Quality Assurance Strategies.

This project is for experimenting with different testing strategies and to identify underlying behaviors
found in the tools needed for the trade of Quality Assurance Engineer.

There are multiple packages we need to use for comprehensive web testing, so we want to use a framework
that provides most of these tools to us prebuilt. 

We use PyTest to structure our tests.
