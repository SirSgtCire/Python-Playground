Hello and welcome to QAS, Quality Assurance Strategies.

This project is for experimenting with different testing strategies and to identify underlying behaviors
found in the tools needed for the trade of Quality Assurance Engineer.

Since we use webdrivers we need to ensure those are up to date, so be sure to check for the latest versions.

PyTest is the main framework in Python we use to control testing, so we leverage this as needed.

Venv is crucial to our work because we need to keep environments clean when testing.

Requests is used to work with API testing.

Selenium is standard for UI testing, web browsing and identifying UI elements.
